crx-ip
======

Chrome/Opera Extension for returning your public IP address.

Uses http://www.whatsmyip.us/showipsimple.php. You could easily bookmark that URL, but I hide my bookmarks bar and wanted take a stab at Chrome Extensions.

*Now works with Opera 15+.*

Installation
------------

1. All you need is the .crx file. Download that to your computer.
2. Open chrome://extensions/ in Google Chrome. Open opera://extensions in Opera.
3. Drag the .crx file onto the extensions page.

###!important###
You must drag the file onto the extensions page. Dragging onto some other page, or double-clicking, will result in a warning from Chrome and no action from Opera.
